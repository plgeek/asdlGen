<title>INSTALL notes for &asdlGen; version &asdlGen.version;
<author>&author.danwang;
<date>&asdlGen.release-date;

<p> In order of build and install &asdlGen; you must have SML/NJ version
110.0.6 installed. SML/NJ is available for both Unix and Win32. &asdlGen;
should build easily on a unix box with SML/NJ installed. On a Win32 box it
should also build if you have the Cygwin environment installed, but can be
built manually if need be. (Note: I haven't tested the build on Win32).

See <htmlurl url="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html" 
     name="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html"> for
     information on obtaining and installing SML/NJ.

See <htmlurl url="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/"
     name="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/"> for information on
     obtaining and installing Cygwin.
<p>
The only <tt/make/ file of any interest is the toplevel
one. It calls SML to build the system. The ML code determines certain
useful pieces of information about the current system  using <tt/GNU autoconf/.
<code>
% ./configure --prefix=<install-prefix>
% make all
