<P>One of the most important features of <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> is that it automatically
produces functions that can read and write the data structures it generates
to and from a platform and language independent external
representation. This process of converting data structures in memory into a
sequence of bytes on the disk is referred to as pickling. Since from a
single ASDL specification <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> produces both data structures and
pickling code for C, C++, Java, Standard ML, and Haskell, <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> provides an easy
and efficient way to share complex data structures among these languages.

<P>As part of the output code every defined type has a <CODE>read</CODE> and <CODE>write</CODE>
function that writes values of that type to or from a stream. There are also
<CODE>read_tagged</CODE> and <CODE>write_tagged</CODE> functions that first output a unique
tag before writing out the rest of the type. These functions are useful when
you expect to write several different kinds of pickles to the same stream
and want a minimal level of error checking. 
<P>The ASDL pickle format requires that both the reader and writer
of the pickler agree on the type of the pickle. Other than constructor tags
for sum types, there is no explicit type information in the pickle. In the
case of an error the behavior is undefined. It is also important for the
streams to be opened in binary mode to prevent line feed translations from
corrupting the pickle. 
<P><EM>Plans are being made to support a text based pickle format similar to
XML/SGML</EM>

<P><CODE>asdlGen</CODE> has an option that will dump pickles into either a simple
textual format or HTML. In order to display a pickle <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> needs
to have a description of the type environment and the name of the type
in the pickle. A description of the type environment, which produced
the pickle, is obtained by running <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> with the <CODE>--typ</CODE> option
on the set of files that describe the modules that produced the code
which produced the pickle. The resulting <CODE>env.typ</CODE> should be the
first file provided to <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> after the <CODE>--pp_pkl</CODE>
argument. The <CODE>--output_file</CODE>> option can be use to change the name
of the resulting type environment. The file that contains the pickle
comes next, and finally a list of fully qualified type identifiers
that describe the pickles in the file.

<H2><A NAME="ss6.3">6.3 Pickle Format Details</A>
</H2>

<P> The format of the data is described in
detail below for description writers that use the <CODE>reader</CODE> and
<CODE>writer</CODE> properties to replace the default pickling code for whatever
reason.
<P>Since ASDL data structures have a tree-like form, they can be represented
linearly with a simple prefix encoding. It is easy to generate functions
that convert to and from the linear form.  A pre-order walk of the data
structure is all that's needed. The walk is implemented as recursively
defined functions for each type in an ASDL definition. Each function visits
a node of that type and recursively walks the rest of the tree. Functions
that write a value take as their first argument the value to write. The
second argument is the stream that is to be written to. Functions that read
values take the stream they are to read the value from as their single
argument and return the value read. 
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>int</B><DD><P>Since ASDL integers are intended to be of infinite precision they are
represented with a variable-length, signed-magnitude encoding.  The
eight bit of each byte indicates if a given byte is the last byte of
the integer encoding. The seventh bit of the most significant byte is
used to determine the sign of the value. Numbers in the range of -63
to 63 can be encoded in one byte. Numbers out of this range require an
extra byte for every seven bits of precision needed.  Bytes are
written out in little-endian order. If most integer values tend to be
values near zero, this encoding of integers may use less space than a
fixed precision representation.
<P>
<DT><B>string</B><DD><P>Strings are represented with a length-header that describe how many more
8-bit bytes follow for the string and then the data for the string in
bytes. The length-header is encoded with the same arbitrary precision
integer encoding described previously.
<P>
<DT><B>identifier</B><DD><P>Identifiers are represented as if they were strings. 
<P>
<DT><B>product types</B><DD><P>Product types are represented sequentially without any tag. The fields of
the product type are packed from left to right.
<P>
<DT><B>sum types</B><DD><P>Sum types begin with a unique tag to identify the constructor
followed sequentially by the fields of the constructor.  Tag values are
assigned based on the order of constructor definition in the
description. The first constructor has a tag value of one. Fields are packed
left to right based of the order in the definition.  If there are any
attribute values associated with the type, they are packed left to right
after the tag but before other constructor fields. The tag is encoded with
the same arbitrary precision integer encoding described previously.
<P>
<DT><B>sequence qualified types</B><DD><P>Sequence types are represented with an integer length-header followed by
that many values of that type. The length-header is encoded with the same
arbitrary precision integer encoding described previously.
<P>
<DT><B>option qualified types</B><DD><P>Optional values are preceded by an integer header that is either one or
zero. A zero indicates that the value is empty (NONE, nil, or NULL) and no
more data follows. A one indicates that the next value is the value of the
optional value. The header is encoded with the same arbitrary precision
integer encoding described previously.
