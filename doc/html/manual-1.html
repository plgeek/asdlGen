Lanuguage (ASDL) is a language designed to describe the tree-like data
structures in compilers. Its main goal is to provide a method for
compiler components written in different languages to
interoperate. ASDL makes it easier for applications written in a
variety of programming languages to communicate complex recursive data
structures. 
<P><CODE>asdlGen</CODE> is a tool that takes ASDL descriptions and produces
implementations of those descriptions in a variety of popular
languages. ASDL and <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> together provide the following advantages
<UL>
<LI>Concise descriptions of important data structures.
</LI>
<LI>Automatic generation of data structure implementations for
C, C++, Java, Standard ML, and Haskell.
</LI>
<LI>Automatic generation of functions to read and write the data
structures to disk in a machine and language independent way.</LI>
</UL>
<P>ASDL descriptions describe the tree-like data structures such as
abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and compiler intermediate representations
(IRs). Tools such as <CODE>asdlGen</CODE> automatically produce the equivalent
data structure definitions for C, C++, Java, Standard ML, and Haskell.
<CODE>asdlGen</CODE> also produces functions for each language that read and
write the data structures to and from a platform and language
independent sequence of bytes. The sequence of bytes is called a
<EM>pickle</EM>.
<P>ASDL pickles can be interactively viewed and edited with a graphical
<A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/zephyr/browser">browser</A>, or pretty printed into a
simple textual format. The browser provides some advanced features
such as display styles and tree based versions of standard unix tools
such as <CODE>diff</CODE> and <CODE>grep</CODE>. ASDL is part of the Zephyr
