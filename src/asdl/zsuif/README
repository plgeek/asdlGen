This is a preliminary SUIF to ZSUIF translator, it builds a SUIF 2.0
back-end pass the converts a SUIF 2.0 file into a ZSUIF pickle
suitable for browsing. It compiles and builds under the latest SUIF
2.0 alpha version (basesuif-2.0.0.alpha.720) and
suifversion1support-1.0.0.alpha.60. The contents of this directory
must be unpacked in src/asdl/zsuif of the asdlGen source
distribution to build correctly. 

It builds cleanly under Solaris 2.5.1 using the SunPro compiler. To
get everything to link properly you need to reinstall libcii.a and
libasdl.a compiled with position independent code. Do the following in
the asdlGen 1.2 directory
	
 % cd src/c 
 % make clean

if using the native cc
 % make CFLAGS="-KPIC" 
or if using gcc
 % make CFLAGS="-fPIC" 

 % make install

After this you need to set up the SUIF 2.0 environment variables
correctly and set ASDL_HOME to the base install directory of
asdlGen. Then

 % cd src/asdl/zsuif
 % make install

should install the SUIF 2.0 pass do_zsuif_gateway in the appropriate place.

To build the ZSUIF->VPO code run the build.sh script in this
directory. You must have Standard ML of New Jersey version 110.0.3
installed for this to build. It should produce a SML heap file called
zsuif2vpo.

Once you've created a SUIF2.0 file you can convert it into a ZSUIF
file by invoking do_zsuif_gateway
   % do_zsuif_gateway {infile} {outfile}.zsuif

To convert the ZSUIF file into vpo code you should do the following.

   % sml @SMLload=zsuif2vpo foo.zsuif 

N.B. The file must end with a ".zsuif" it should produce a ".dec" file.
