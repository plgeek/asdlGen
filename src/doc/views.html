<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<pre>
module IntMap {
  int_map = (int size,entries map)
  entries = (entry* entries)
  entry = (int key, int value)
}
</pre>

The above is one possible abstract description of a mapping from integers to
integers.  It would be more efficient to <em>implement</em> such a mapping as
a binary tree. Described as with the ASDL definition below.
<pre>
module IntMap {
  int_map = (size int,map tree)
  tree = Node(int key,int value,tree left,tree right)
       | Empty
}
</pre>
<p>
Although this is a much more efficient representation it exposes
implementation details in the pickle. If we decided to change the
implementation of <tt>int_maps</tt> to use a hash table the underlying
pickle format will change too, and all other clients that use our pickles
will have to be updated.
<p>
Views let you write the first version so you get a simple and abstract
representation on the disk, while letting you choose a different efficient
in-core representation. They do this by letting the user control how
<tt>asdlGen</tt> converts the description of a module into an actual
implementation. 

<h1>Syntax</h1>
Here's the view syntax in EBNF. <b> This is all a hack right now the syntax
is likely to change</b>.
<pre>
view       = "view" id "{" {view_entry} "}"
view_entry = id "." {id} "&lt;=" id lit_txt
           | "module" id "&lt;=" id lit_txt
</pre>
where lit_txt is either a ":" followed by some arbitrary text that continues
to the end of the line or a "%%" balanced by a "%%" at the beginning of a
line. The lit_txt is then passed to another internal parser that interprets
the string based on the property name. <em> This is a hack to make the view
mechanism extendible without changing the grammar.</em>

<h1>Example</h1>
<pre>
module IntMap {
  int_map = (int size,entries map)
  entries = (entry* entries)
  entry = (int key, int value)
}
view C {

  IntMap.entries &lt;= natural_type          : Bst.bst
  IntMap.entries &lt;= wrapper               : entries2bst
  IntMap.entries &lt;= unwrapper             : bst2entries
  module  IntMap &lt;= interface_prologue    
%%
#include "bst.h"
%%

  module  IntMap &lt;= implementation_prologue
%%
  /* proto_types for wrapper functions */
  static entries2bst(IntMap_entries_ty x) {
    /* code to convert int_map to a bst */ 
 }

  static IntMap_entries_ty bst2entries(Bst_bst_ty x) {
 /* code to convert bst to an int map */
 }
%%
}

view C_with_HT {

  IntMap.entries &lt;= natural_type          : Ht.ht
  IntMap.entries &lt;= wrapper               : entries2ht
  IntMap.entries &lt;= unwrapper             : ht2entries
  module IntMap  &lt;= interface_prologue    : #include "ht.h"
  module IntMap  &lt;= implementation_prologue 
%%
 /* ... */
%%
}
</pre>
<p>
Views like modules are named. In this example we have two different views
named <tt>C</tt> and <tt>C_with_HT</tt>. By default when translating a
module <tt>asdlGen</tt> looks for a language specific view depending on the
type of output code. When <tt>asdlGen</tt> is invoked with <tt>--lang</tt> it 
looks for the viewed named <tt>Lang</tt>. The default view can be overridden
with the <tt>--view</tt> command line. 

<p>N.B. Currently only the C and SML translators do anything interesting
with the view data.
<p>
Views contain entries of the form
<center>
   <em>entity</em> &lt;= <em> property_name </em> <em> value </em>
</center>

Entities name either an ASDL type, constructor, or module. Some entries are
language independent others are language dependent.  You can have many views
with the same name. The entries of two views with the same name are merged
and consists of the union of the entries in both. If two views name the same
entity, it is an error. <b>Currently I don't check for this so you randomly
get one or the other.</b>
<p>
It is illegal to name an ASDL base type as an entity. e.g.
<center>
int &lt;= ...
</center>
<em>This restriction maybe removed in the future.</em>

<p>For example <tt>natural_type</tt> is a property that is a language
independent identifier which names the type identifier which describes
the in-core type to use <em>in place of</em> <tt>entries</tt>. In the first
view it refers to the type <tt>bst</tt> which lives in a <tt>Bst</tt>
module. It is mangled so that it appears in the C code as
<tt>Bst_bst_ty</tt>.  Using the standard ASDL mangling conventions.

<p>The module properties <tt>interface_prologue</tt> and
<tt>implementation_prologue</tt> are language dependent since they allow the
literal inclusion of arbitrary user defined code in the output. In future
there will be better support to split  the language dependent and
independent parts of views, as well as support to inherit or import entries 
from other views.

<p>Running <tt>asdlGen</tt> on the above code produces <a
href=IntMap.h><tt>IntMap.h</tt></a> and <a
href=IntMap.c><tt>IntMap.c</tt></a>.  Notice how the definition for the
<tt>entries</tt> type is not completely removed. You need this type
definition in order to write the conversion functions. Everywhere there
normally would have been a <tt>IntMap_entires_ty</tt> type there now is the
user type <tt>Bst_bst_ty</tt>.  For example there is still a constructor
prototype and constructor for <tt>IntMap_entries_ty</tt>. But the
<tt>IntMap_int_map</tt> constructor now expects an argument of type
<tt>Bst_bst_ty</tt>. The structs also reflect this.

<pre>
IntMap_entries_ty IntMap_entries(IntMap_entry_list_ty entries);
IntMap_int_map_ty IntMap_int_map(int_ty size, Bst_bst_ty map); 
</pre>
Notice also that the pickle functions now return and expect a
<tt>Bst_bst_ty</tt> 
<pre>
Bst_bst_ty IntMap_read_entries(instream_ty s);
void IntMap_write_entries(Bst_bst_ty x, outstream_ty s);
</pre>
<p>The implementation of the pickle functions now also call the user
supplied <tt>wrapper</tt> and <tt>unwrapper</tt> functions. The
<tt>wrapper</tt> and <tt>unwrapper</tt> function names are language
<em>independent</em> identifiers. It just so happens they don't need to be
mangled. Since they're also local to our implementation we don't qualify
them.
<pre>
Bst_bst_ty IntMap_read_entries(instream_ty s)
{
     Bst_bst_ty ret;
     ....
          tmp->entries = IntMap_read_entry_list(s);
          ret = bst2entries(tmp);
     return ret;
}

void IntMap_write_entries(Bst_bst_ty x, outstream_ty s)
{
    IntMap_entries_ty tmp;
    tmp = entries2bst(x);
    IntMap_write_entry_list(tmp->entries, s);
}
</pre>
