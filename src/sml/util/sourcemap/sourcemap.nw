\section{Source locations}

The goal of this interface is to map character positions to
locations in source files, where a location is described in
``file-line-column'' format.
The major type exported by this interface is [[sourcemap]], which
maintains the mapping.
This way, most of a compiler can work with character positions, but we
can use real source locations in error messages.

A \emph{region} represents a contiguous span of
source locations as seen by the compiler.
Because of preprocessing, any region could be spread out over multiple
overlapping regions in the original source.

A source map is maintained as mutable state.
We create such a map by giving the initial character position, file
name, line, and column number.
Column numbers are obtained by counting characters from the beginning
of the line; the first character on the line is deemed to be in
column~1.
Tabs are given no special treatment.

Character positions increase as the compiler moves through the source,
and the lexer mutates the source map any time something interesting
happens.
The two interesting events are:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The lexer encounters a newline (changing the line number in the source
file).
\item
The lexer encounters \verb+#line+ or its equivalent, changing the
source coordinates.
By analogy with the \texttt{{\tt lcc}} implementation, I call this
event a \emph{resynchronization}.
A resynchronization must change the line number.
It may change the file name and column number; if not specified they
default to the current file name and~1, respectively.
As suggested by John Reppy,
a resynchronization can specify a line number of~0 (in order to make
the numbering of the following line come out right).
\end{itemize}
Character positions must be nonnegative, and they must
increase in successive mutations of a single
[[sourcemap]] (where the initialization counts as a mutation).

[[forgetOldPositions]] causes the sourcemap to discard information
about positions already known to the source map.
Subsequent queries may refer only to new positions (which must still
be larger than the old ones).
The only reason to call [[forgetOldPositions]] is to avoid space leaks.

[[lastChange]] returns the position of the last mutation, or the
initial position if no mutations have taken place.

[[filepos]] and [[fileregion]] map character positions and regions
back to the source level.
If the null region is passed to [[fileregion]], it returns the empty list.
In any pair returned by [[fileregion]], the two source locations are
guaranteed to have the same file name.
[[newlineCount]] returns the number of newlines that occurred in the given
region.

@ I can imagine at least three implementations: one that doesn't
support resynchronization, one that supports resynchronization only at
column 1, and one that supports arbitrary resynchronization.

\section{Implementation}
This implementation supports arbitary resynchronization.

@ 
A character position is an integer.  A region is delimited by the
position of the start character and one beyond the end.
It might help to think of Icon-style positions, which fall between
characters.
<<toplevel>>=
type charpos = int
type 'a pair = 'a * 'a
type region = charpos pair
val nullRegion : region = (0,0)
type sourceloc = {fileName:string, line:int, column:int}
@ The empty region is conventional.
<<toplevel>>=
fun span ((0,0), r) = r
  | span (r, (0,0)) = r
  | span ((l1, h1), (l2, h2)) = if l1 < h2 then (l1, h2) else (l2, h1)
@
The representation is a pair of lists.
[[linePos]] records line numbers for newlines \emph{and}
resynchronization.
[[resynchPos]] records file name and column for resynchronization.
The representation satisfies these invariants:
\begin{itemize}
\item
The lists are never empty (initialization is treated as a resynchronization).
\item
Positions decrease as we walk down the lists.
\item
The last element in each list contains the smallest valid position.
\item
For every element in [[resynchPos]], there is a corresponding element in
[[linePos]] with the same position.
\end{itemize}
We could get even more clever and store file names only when they
differ, but it doesn't seem worth it---we would have to get very
clever about tracking column numbers and resynchronizations.
<<toplevel>>=
type sourcemap = {resynchPos: (charpos * string * int) list ref,
                  linePos:    (charpos * int)          list ref}

fun newmap (pos, {fileName, line, column}: sourceloc) : sourcemap =
  {resynchPos = ref [(pos, fileName, column)], linePos = ref [(pos, line)]}

fun resynch ({resynchPos, linePos}: sourcemap) (pos, {fileName, line, column}) =
  let val curFile = #2 (hd (!resynchPos))
      fun thefile (SOME file) = if file = curFile then curFile else file
				   (* pathetic attempt at hash-consing *)
        | thefile NONE        = #2 (hd (!resynchPos))
      fun thecol NONE     = 1
        | thecol (SOME c) = c
  in  resynchPos := (pos, thefile fileName, thecol column) :: !resynchPos;
      linePos := (pos, line) :: !linePos
  end
@ 
Since [[pos]] is the position of the newline, the next line doesn't
start until the succeeding position.
<<toplevel>>=
fun newline ({resynchPos, linePos}: sourcemap) pos =
  let val (_, line) = hd (!linePos)
  in  linePos := (pos+1, line+1) :: !linePos
  end

fun lastChange({linePos, ...}: sourcemap) = #1 (hd (!linePos))
@ 
A generally useful thing to do is to remove from the lists the initial
sequences of tuples
whose positions satisfy some predicate:
<<toplevel>>=
fun remove p ({resynchPos,linePos}: sourcemap) =
  let fun strip (l as (pos, _   )::rest) = if p pos then strip  rest else l
        | strip [] = []
      fun strip'(l as (pos, _, _)::rest) = if p pos then strip' rest else l
        | strip'[] = []
  in  (strip'(!resynchPos), strip (!linePos))
  end
@ 
We find file and line number by linear search.
The first position less than [[p]] is what we want.
The initial column depends on whether we resynchronized.
<<toplevel>>=
fun column ((pos, file, col), (pos', line), p) =
  if pos = pos' then p - pos + col else p - pos' + 1

fun filepos smap p : sourceloc =
    let val (files, lines) = remove (fn pos : int => pos > p) smap
        val xx as (_, file, _) = hd files
        val yy as (_, line)    = hd lines
    in  {fileName = file, line = line, column = column(xx, yy, p)}
    end
@ Searching regions is a bit trickier, since we track file and line
simultaneously.  We exploit the invariant that every file entry has a
corresponding line entry.
We also exploit that only file entries correspond to new regions.
<<toplevel>>=
fun fileregion smap (lo, hi) =
  if (lo,hi) = nullRegion then [] else
  let exception Impossible
      fun gather((p, file, col)::files, (p', line)::lines, region_end, answers) =
        if p' <= lo then (* last item *)
          ({fileName=file, line=line, column=column((p, file, col), (p', line), lo)}, 
           region_end) :: answers
        else
          if p < p' then
            gather((p, file, col)::files, lines, region_end, answers)
          else (* p = p'; new region *)
            gather(files, lines, end_of (p, hd files, hd lines), 
                 ({fileName = file, line = line, column = col}, region_end) :: answers)
        | gather _ = raise Impossible
      and end_of(lastpos, xx as (p, file, col), yy as (p', line)) = 
             {fileName=file, line=line, column=column(xx, yy, lastpos)}
      val (files, lines) = remove (fn pos : int => pos >= hi andalso pos > lo) smap
      val _ = if null files orelse null lines then raise Impossible else ()
      val answer = gather(files, lines, end_of(hi, hd files, hd lines), [])
      fun validate(({fileName=f,  line=l,  column=c}, 
                    {fileName=f', line=l', column=c'}) :: rest) = 
            if f = f' andalso (l' > l orelse (l' = l andalso c' >= c)) then
              validate rest 
            else 
              raise Impossible
        | validate [] = ()
  in  validate answer; answer
  end
@ [[validate]] checks the invariant that single regions occupy a
single source file and that coordinates are nondecreasing.
We have to be careful not to remove the entry for [[lo]] when 
[[pos = hi = lo]].
@
<<toplevel>>=
fun positions({resynchPos,linePos}: sourcemap) (src:sourceloc) =
  let exception Unimplemented
  in  raise Unimplemented
  end
@
When discarding old positions, we have to be careful to maintain the
last part of the invariant.
<<toplevel>>=
fun forgetOldPositions ({resynchPos, linePos} : sourcemap) =
  let val r as (p,  file, col) = hd (!resynchPos)
      val l as (p', line)      = hd (!linePos)
  in  linePos := [l];
      resynchPos := [if p = p' then r else (p', file, 1)]
  end
@ 
<<toplevel>>= 
fun newlineCount smap (lo, hi) =
  let val (hifiles, hilines) = remove (fn pos : int => pos >= hi andalso pos > lo) smap
      val (lofiles, lolines) = remove (fn pos : int =>                   pos > lo) smap
  in  length hilines - length hifiles - (length lolines - length lofiles)
  end
