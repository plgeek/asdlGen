  INSTALL notes for asdlGen version 2.0-beta
  Daniel C. Wang
  February 14, 2000

  In order of build and install asdlGen you must have SML/NJ version
  110.0.6 installed. SML/NJ is available for both Unix and Win32.
  asdlGen should build easily on a unix box with SML/NJ installed. On a
  Win32 box it should also build if you have the Cygwin environment
  installed, but can be built manually if need be. (Note: I haven't
  tested the build on Win32).

  See http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/index.html for
  information on obtaining and installing SML/NJ.

  See http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/ for information on obtaining
  and installing Cygwin.

  The only make file of any interest is the toplevel one. It calls SML
  to build the system. The ML code determines certain useful pieces of
  information about the current system  using GNU autoconf.
