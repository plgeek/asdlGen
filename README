  README for asdlGen version 2.0-beta
  Daniel C. Wang
  February 14, 2000

  This is beta release asdlGen. Many of the internals have been
  significantly reworked, and most of the major internal interfaces have
  been documented. There have been also several significant changes to
  various backends, and a different compilation model for the generated
  code.


  In the past asdlGen assumed the existence of several support libraries
  that it would link with the source code produced by it. This made
  installing asdlGen quiet a non-trivial task. In the new model asdlGen
  will by default emit all the necessary source code needed to compile
  the world, rather than assuming the existence of asdlGen specific
  libraries. The C code still requires libcii.a which is included
  verbatim but not built in the current distribution.


  There's still work to do, most importantly documenting many of the new
  features and providing some good examples. The old user manual is out
  of date but it's better then nothing.


  Also, asdlGen is designed to make inter-language operation easier. It
  may not exploit or produce the most idiomatic code for a given
  language, advice on how to improve the code for a given language will
  be appreciated.

  Dumps a SML/NJ heap for asdlGen in src/sml/. The install rules will
  change in the future. It currently doesn't produce any stand-alone
  executables.

  Major Changes/Features include


  o  Support for SML97, Haskell98, OCaml-2.0, Java, C++, C, and Icon.

  o  Reworked command line handling and command line options. asdlGen
     --help is now much more informative.

  o  asdlGen can optionally output dependency information for make or
     language appropriate build system.

  o  Reworked pretty printing for all the backends to produce more
     readable code.

  o  Currently dropped support for pickle pretty-printer, it will be
     reincarnated some time in the future.

  o  Java and C++ backends now use generic/templated arrays to implement
     sequence and option types.

  o  Experimental support for preservation of sharing and XML.

  o  SML97, Haskell98, and Ocaml-2.0 supports an "s-expression" ASCII
     picklers. Useful for debugging.

  o  Ability for users to define there own primitive types.

  o  New syntax for importing modules

     ___________________________________________________________________
     module T (imports VeryLongModuleName alias M) {
      foo = (M.t)
     }
     ___________________________________________________________________



  o  Better name mangling schemes.

  o  Support for user defined primitives. Rather than hard coding
     information about user primitive types into asdlGen primitives are
     now extensible. In particular the old primitive types of int,
     string, identifier. Are implemented by pre-appending the following
     declaration to all inputs

     ___________________________________________________________________
     primitive module StdPrims {
      int string identifier
     }
     ___________________________________________________________________


  asdlGen tacks this on to any set of input files to remain compatible
  with existing code. Users, can add their own primitive types by simply
  including there own primitive module declaration. See src/asdl/std-
  types.asdl for an example that defines a richer set fix width integer
  and word types, for various languages.

  o  Support for an unnamed "Toplevel" module. Allowing one to generate
     less verbose code for pedagogical purposes. See
     src/asdl/tests/toplevel.asdl for an example usage.
